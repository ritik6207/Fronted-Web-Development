There are two type of varibale in javascript 
1. var (oldest one)
2. let (introduce in 2015)

the variable is lose coupled that's means no need to initilize data type
for ex:- let varibale
        variable Name
           ^
           |
           |
           |
      let abc = "Hello world";
      let ps = 5;
      let ty = 9.3;
      let ft = 'y'

also we can use let or not dose't matter
variable name cann't be use twice


for var varibale , no need to write var to initilize the variable
for ex: var
abc = "Hello world";
ps = 5;
ty = 9.3;
ft = 'y'
variable name can be use twice


Q. How to incure wchich variable are use?
ans:- use "use strict" at the top of script file.
if we use "use strict" spript file , var keyword is invalid, in this condition to initilize the varibale name thats mean let
